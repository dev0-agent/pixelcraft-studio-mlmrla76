Key features:
- Tracks `originalImageSrc` and `currentImageSrc`.
- Manages `adjustments` (brightness, contrast, saturation, blur, hue, rotation, sepia, grayscale).
- Handles `crop` (x, y, width, height, aspect) and `zoom` level.
- Implements `history` stack with `undo`, `redo`, and snapshot capabilities.
- Includes `reset` functionality to revert to original state.

This lays the foundation for the image editor's core functionality as per Phase 1 tasks.","notes":"Created `src/store/useImageStore.ts` with all required state and actions. Verified with a test script."}
